        Target audience
 There are two distinct target audiences for this project. Salon managers and owners make up the first primary audience for this project.
 They will use the salon side of the web application.
 
Salon-goers, primarily female, are the second major audience. They will
use the client side of the application, primarily using it to browse local
salons, view user ratings, and make appointments online, all on demand.

        Technology
Our project uses MySQL and PHP to back the interface with strong database functionality.
For the front-end development, we will use HTML and javaScript widgets to style the site and create a simple, clean interface.
